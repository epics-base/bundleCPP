# EPICS V4 Release 4.x.0 C++ Bundle Release Notes

This document contains the Release Notes entries from each individual C++
submodule for this bundled version of EPICS V4.
For future patch releases any notes about patch changes will supplement the note entries from the original release.

### Compatibilty

This release can be built against EPICS Base versions 3.15.x or 3.16.x. Later versions of EPICS Base are referred to as EPICS 7 and already include all the necessary V4 modules. EPICS Base versions 3.14.12.x and earlier may not be compatible with the V4 modules in this release and are no longer supported.

The pvCommonCPP module has been removed. As a result this bundle will no longer compile for VxWorks targets. Developers wanting to use EPICS V4 modules with VxWorks should upgrade to EPICS 7, which still supports recent versions of VxWorks-6 and comes with the PVA modules built in.
